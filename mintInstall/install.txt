after installation reboot pc and press Esc until grub command line is shown
then type "normal" then press enter then keep pressing Esc
on linux mint press E. 
find line that starts with "linux" and ends with "quite splash"
at the end of that line add two spaces and type either "nomodeset" or "nouveau.modeset=0" and press "F10"
when os is loaded open driver manager and select nvidia-driver-470 (it should be recomended, 09.11.23 nvidia-driver-535 was recommended)
wait till it is downloaded and installed then reboot=))
